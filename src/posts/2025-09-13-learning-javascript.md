# My First Steps with JavaScript

JavaScript felt scary at first. There were so many tutorials, frameworks, and tools that I didn’t know where to begin. I decided to start small: just writing scripts that ran in the browser console.

The first time I made the text on a page change with `document.querySelector`, I felt like a magician. That moment was enough to spark curiosity. I started building tiny apps, like a to-do list and a random quote generator.

What I like about JavaScript is that it’s immediate. You can write code, refresh the page, and see results instantly. It gives me the motivation to keep experimenting and learning more.
