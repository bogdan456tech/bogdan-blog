# Why I Started Blogging

I’ve always liked the idea of writing down my thoughts, but I never made the time for it. Starting this blog is my way of practicing consistency and sharing my journey as a software engineering student.

Blogging is more than just writing. It’s about documenting progress, reflecting on mistakes, and helping others who may face the same challenges. I hope that by putting my experiences online, someone out there can learn something new or at least feel less alone in their struggles.

This blog will be about everything I’m learning — from coding experiments to personal growth. Even if nobody reads it, I know that future me will be glad I kept a record.
