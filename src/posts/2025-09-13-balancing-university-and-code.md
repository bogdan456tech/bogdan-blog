# Balancing University and Coding Projects

Being a student means juggling lectures, assignments, and exams. On top of that, I want to keep improving my coding skills and working on side projects. Finding balance hasn’t been easy.

One trick that helps me is breaking tasks into small goals. Instead of saying *“I’ll finish this entire app today”*, I just aim to complete one feature. Sometimes it’s only 30 minutes of focused work, but that’s enough to make progress.

The important part is to stay consistent. Even slow progress builds up over weeks. My hope is that this blog will also serve as motivation to stay on track.
